Chrome.


## Try it now

Install Firefox Nightly and download pussy-avatar.xpi file from this repo. Drag
and drop the xpi file on the web browser.

toggle `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `False`.

(Try on Google Chrome)[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/lets_write_a_webextension/]


## Building

1. Install `gulp-cli` system wide with `npm i gulp-cli -g`.
2. Install node dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Start building with `npm run build` or just `gulp`.

This would generate `pussy-avatar.xpi`.
